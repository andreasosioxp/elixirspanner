# Live refactoring in Elixir: readability matter
--------------------------------------------------

## Readability really matter!

"Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code
is a violent psychopath who knows where you live."
(John F. Woods)

## Spot the differences

Study your new programming language.
Spot syntax differences between it and your usual programming language.
Try them. See if they can help your readability.

## Refactor covered by tests

You couldn't do it without them
especially studying a new programming language.

## Love Elixir

Best syntax I've ever seen.

(and love Vim as well)
