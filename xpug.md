# Live refactoring in Elixir: readability matter
--------------------------------------------------

## Readability really matter!

"Always code as if the person who ends up maintaining your code
is a violent psychopath who knows where you live."
(John F. Woods)

## Spots the differences

Study your new programming language.
Spot syntax differences between it and your usual programming language.
Try them. See if they can help your readability.

## Loves Elixir

Best syntax I've ever seen.

(and loves Vim as well)
